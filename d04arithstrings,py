'''Python supports concatenating strings using the addition operator:
my_string = "Hello" + " " + "InterviewBit"
Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence:
my_string = "InterviewBit" * 5
Try the following example in the editor below.
Print “InterviewBit” 100 times without space on a same line.'''
